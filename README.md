# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Timur Sultanov

Student Number: C18395266

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
This assignment presents a simple but visual response to sound or music applied to the program. Using the minim library, the program uses the sounds volume to map how fast the soud waves must go and it is mapped out in a dimensional box type of tunnel with a spiral able to be enabled which also responds to the music tempo. There is also a multi colored cube with 3 axis rotation where all 3 axis can be locked or unlocked the user of the program.

# Instructions
The program plays a default tunnel reponse to music.
'Space' - activates the secondary view which demonstrates a cube locked in place expanding and deflating.
'Z' - unlocks the cubes ability to rotate along the vertical axis.
'X' - unlocks the cubes ability to rotate along the horizontal axis.
'C' - unlocks the cubes ability to rotate along the diagonal axis.
'V' - enabled on screen spiral in the starting/tunnel screen which responds to music.

# How it works
Using the minim library the configured shapes and patterns respond to music and its tempo/volume. Hitting the mentioned keybinds does additional features.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I'm most proud of being able to advance my programming skills and learning to program with external libraries. The ability to visually see your work in different colors with live reponse to any selected music of yours is rewarding because you're able to see that you have done it yourself.
